Nationality: China
Hobbies: 
Watching movies has always been my go to activity for all occasions. My love for movies start with Avatar, I remember I was ten years old when I first saw this movie on a Pirated CD because the movie was so popular at the time and the cinema was not as universal as it is now, but anyway I was still impressed by the fancy special effects and fascinating story. Avatar really opened another world for me. Additionally, basketball is one of my biggest interests, love watching NBA, big fan of GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS.


<h2>2.Interest in IT </h2>
<p> 
●What is your interest in IT?
 <br>
Well, I enjoy programming, especially, it gives me a sense of satisfaction when I accomplished a small project or a program.  
</p>



●When did your interest in IT start? 

Back in high school, it starts with a little programming  project “Hello World!”. I followed my teacher step by step and I still remember the feeling when “Hello World!” appeared on my computer screen, it’s so unreal like the computer in front of me is alive and I just find the right language to communicate with him.

●Outline your IT experience (if any).

I learned a very basic programming language called visual basic back in high school. And I started to learn c++ on online courses by myself this year. And if you count game as IT experience well I have played lots of them, CS, CF, LOL, GTA (1,2,3,4,5)…


● Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

Well, after I finish my college entrance examination, I chose to study abroad. And rmit sent me an offer without the need to attend Foundation which takes almost a year as long as I pass the IELTS test. Besides, studying abroad is really an eye- opening journey.


● What do you expect to learn during your studies?

I want to learn more programming languages and develop multiple  ways in terms of solving the problems. And learn to work as a group, develop some valuable skills that  I may need in my future career.
